Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University in the Clinical and Affective Neuroscience lab. Here, I take a cognitive and affective neuroscience approach to understanding the brain basis of craving in substance use disorders (SUDs), and ultimately aim to leverage this understanding toward developing novel interventions for SUDs. 

My graduate research focused on individual differences in response to ambiguous emotional signals. Canonically, this individual difference has been studies by examining responses to surprised facial expressions. This is because, in the absence of clarifying context, surprised expressions predict both positive (e.g., winning the lottery) and negative (e.g., losing a big gamble) outcomes. In the absence of context, individuals differ in their tendency to ascribe more positive versus more negative meaning to such signals (this is known as one's valence bias). This raises the question: How do different people arrive at different interpretations of the same emotional signal? 

In one project, I sought to examine this individual difference in the context of ambiguous language. For example, some words - like "batter" - have both positive ("baseball batter") or negative ("domestic violence") meanings. 

My winemaking has focused on trying to get big, bold red flavors out of mostly inexpensive wine kits. It's going okay. Check out the winemaking section for a history of the wine kits that I've tried, along with notes about any tweaks (e.g., changing the yeast, additives, etc.).

My music is a small set of home recordings that I've deemed worthy of leaving the depths of my hard drive. I play the guitars, bass, keys, drum machine, etc. unless otherwise noted.
