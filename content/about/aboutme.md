My research has focused on individual differences in response to emotion signals. For example, some words (e.g., "batter") have both positive ("baseball batter") or negative ("domestic violence") meanings. How do different people arrive at different interpretations of these signals? 

My winemaking has focused on trying to get big, bold red flavors out of mostly inexpensive wine kits. It's going okay. Check out the winemaking section for a history of the wine kits that I've tried, along with notes about any tweaks (e.g., changing the yeast, additives, etc.).

My music is a small set of home recordings that I've deemed worthy of leaving the depths of my hard drive. I play the guitars, bass, keys, drum machine, etc. unless otherwise noted.
